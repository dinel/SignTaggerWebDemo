# Introduction

This is the web interface for the Sign Tagger developed in 
[the FIRST project](http://first-asd.eu). The interface makes use of the machine
learning based [Sign Tagger](https://github.com/dinel/SignTagger) and allows users
to easily visualise signs of syntactic complexity in texts. The interface should
be quite straightforward to use. A screenshot is presented below.

# Demo
